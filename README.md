## Silenced Forests

# About
To get people to understand how their actions affect the environment, we give them a concrete example. Focusing on the Fungus Chytrid that have killed 60% of amphibian species since the â€™80s. The actual cause of the problem is unknown, but all known theories are connected to human behavior.

# Installation
Users were invited to examine the interconnected web of amphibian species. Looking for the four possible causes hidden in the web before the fungi spreads and the forests dies down.
